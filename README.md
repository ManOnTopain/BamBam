## About Cola

Cola is as you guess it, skidded script made by broski(d) 

## PLEASE END THESE GUYS CARRIERS I SWEAR TO GOD

Apparently they promote it saying it's better than prism but it's not

I also want explanation on why the fuck you guys have "prism killaura" in ur banners?

Their own gui is actually dogshit (same as ASStolfos) and whitelist can be cracked easily
