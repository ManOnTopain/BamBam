# Cola Leak

Cola is owned by Broski(d), skid which [p2l](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cstrMrYHeQI&ab_channel=pay2lose) and [zeyhu](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgUjgDnW_1UPbpqJpH-_Djg) exposed for shit

Broskid also owns astolfo which was leaked in 2 days and after leak got discountinued almost instantly.

Astolfo doesn't work anymore because of ui lib change :trol:

## About Cola

Cola is as you guess it, skidded script made by broski(d) and Master (broskid's dick sucker) 

## PLEASE END THESE GUYS CARRIERS I SWEAR TO GOD

Apparently they promote it saying it's better than prism but they actually skid from prism (Master has access to it)

They also self-exposed themselfs in banners saying that they have prism killaura

Their own gui is actually dogshit (same as ASStolfos) and whitelist can be cracked easily

We need to get master removed from prism for skidding from it, if anyone who devs on prism sees this, you know what to do!
